Phase 1, Group 0400

The main method for this program is in the Main class

ReadAndWrite:
    If the program fails to serialize then it corrupts the file and you need to serialize over the file for it to run
    correctly again

Creating events:
    The program will ask for the duration of an event in hours, but the overlapping protection will not work
    unless the input is 1 (all events last for an hour in phase 1)
