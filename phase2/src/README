Phase 1, Group 0400

The main method for this program is in the Main class

ReadAndWrite:
    If the program fails to serialize then it corrupts the file and you need to serialize over the file for it to run
    correctly again

Creating events:
    -You have to create a room and a speaker first in order to create an event. If you don't, then the program will tell
        you that you can't create an event with that information and will redirect you back to try again.
    -When you request to see all the events you have signed up for, you have a further option to look at the details of that event
        -Also the events appear in the order of when the events are. So the the first event that shows up is your next event
    -The program will ask for the duration of an event in hours, but the overlapping protection will not work
    unless the input is 1 (all events last for an hour in phase 1)
