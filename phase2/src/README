ReadAndWrite:
    If the program fails to serialize then it corrupts the file and you need to serialize over the file for it to run
    correctly again

Creating events:
    -You have to create a conference and a room first in order to create an event with no speakers. If you want speakers
        in the event then you have to create them before hand If you don't, then the program will tell
        you that you can't create an event with that information and will redirect you back to try again.
    -When you request to see all the events you have signed up for, you have a further option to look at the details of that event
        -Also the events appear in the order of when the events are. So the the first event that shows up is your next event
    -The program will ask for the duration of an event in hours, must be an integer greater than 0. If it is not a
        correct input it will tell you so and you get to re-enter the duration
